    This is an error controlled, variable time step Integrator that simulates a System using Langevin dynamics. It
    compares the result of the Langevin integrator to that of an explicit Euler integrator, takes the difference between

    steps on average, while still maintaining comparable accuracy to a fixed step size integrator.

    It is best not to think of the error tolerance as having any absolute meaning. It is just an adjustable parameter
    that affects the step size and integration accuracy. You should try different values to find the largest one that
    produces a trajectory sufficiently accurate for your purposes. 0.001 is often a good starting point.
